This android app reminds users to take selfie and helps user to manage pictures :) This is the final project of an android course that I took. It demonstrates some features such as: fragment, adapter, file storage, notifcation, alarm, using camera.

The app will remind users to take pictures after some period of time. All pictures are stored and displayed as a list of pictures using Gallery in a fragment. Select one picture in the list will open another fragment to view that picture. Users can navigate between pictures or delete pictures.
